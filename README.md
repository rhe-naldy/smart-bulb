# smart-bulb

This smart bulb project is a group project made for Embedded Systems course in the fifth semester, where I contributed in the project coding. The coding phase was done using Wokwi to simulate the project, while Arduino IDE was used to fully program a prototype of the smart bulb. The MQTT Protocol was used to send and receive messages between the smart bulb and the dashboard.
