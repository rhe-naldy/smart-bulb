# smart-bulb

This smart bulb project is a group project made for Embedded Systems course in the fifth semester, where I contributed in the project coding. The coding phase was done using Wokwi to simulate the project, while Arduino IDE was used to fully program a prototype of the smart bulb. The MQTT Protocol was used to send and receive messages between the smart bulb and the dashboard. The "Wokwi Code" folder contains the code where simulation was done in Wokwi. Meanwhile, SmartBulb.ino is the prototype code.
